Assuming type is a container that is a map, output the key and value separated
by a comma for Cython code. This is just a convenience to make the code a bit
easier to read in all the places its called. Differs from CythonMapKeyValue
in that it is for use when accessing a struct that is in the same file as
the one including this.
